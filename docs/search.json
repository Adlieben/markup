Students will get to know the professional field of statistical markup and its innovations and challenges. It consists of meetings in which students will learn about markup languages (\\(\\LaTeX\\) and Markdown), learn efficient programming with R Markdown, experience developing Shiny web apps, get to know version control with Git and will create and maintain their own data archive repository and personal (business card) page through GitHub. Combining these lectures, the students get acquainted with different viewpoints on marking up statistical manuscripts, areas of innovation, and challenges that people face when working with, analyzing and reporting (simulated) data. Knowledge obtained from this course will help students face multidimensional problems during their professional career."

It was designed to help with the publishing process by defining the structure and content of documents.\nSGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language): Evolved from GML in the 1980s, SGML became an ISO standard and was used as the basis for several other markup languages, including HTML.\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML became the standard markup language for creating web pages. It‚Äôs a subset of SGML.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): Introduced in the late 1990s, XML was designed to store and transport data.

This is because plain text is used as opposed to other markup languages. However, markup tagging conventions are used to define and stylize document stucture, graphical elements, citations and text.\nMarkdown is an extremely simplified alternative to document preparation software systems. markdown is a lightweigt markup language that can be edited using any text editor, while being quick and easy to compile. It is nowadays widely considered as the language of the internet as it bridges most great attributes of other markup languages.\nQuarto is even more comprehensive as it is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. quarto is aimed at delivering reproducible, consistent Pandoc markdown documents that unify the best of all other markup languages."

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables.

Explain the reasoning for the type of model you‚Äôre fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model‚Äôs predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project video deadline. You only need to email me if you have concerns. Otherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade."

Reproducibility: With renv, you can capture and record the specific package versions used in your project, ensuring reproducibility over time.\n3. Collaboration: Share your project with others, and they can easily recreate the same environment using renv.lock.\n4. Easier Package Installation: renv simplifies package installation. Just run renv::restore() to set up the project environment.\n5. Automatic Snapshot: renv automatically generates a renv.lock file, listing all package versions used, making it easy to recreate the environment.\n6. Compatibility: renv is compatible with popular version control systems like Git, facilitating collaboration and sharing.\n\nUse renv::snapshot() to update the renv.lock file when you add or update packages. You can use renv::activate() and renv::deactivate() to activate or deactivate renv for your project."

    "text": "Git\nGit is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. Git is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project‚Äôs changes.\nYou can see Git as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct Git to log any changes that have been made, Git adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas commits. With every commit an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:\n\nthe changes made\nwho made the changes\nmetadata\na small piece of text that describe the changes made\n\nThe difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called diffs.\nIf you‚Äôd like to know much more about Git, this online book is a very good resource. If you‚Äôd like to practice with the command line interface use this webpage for a quick course. This book covers pretty much everything you need to marry Git and R."

    "text": "GitHub\nGitHub is the social and user interface to Git that allows you to work in repositories. These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between private repositories (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).\nYour public repositories can be viewed and forked by everyone. Forking is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the master. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called branching instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called cloning.\nGitHub‚Äôs ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are merged with the master. If you‚Äôre working in a forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.\nFor now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits GitHub can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the mice package in R can be directly installed from the mice repository with the following code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"stefvanbuuren/mice\")\n\nYou can see that this process requires package devtools that expands the R functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in R directly from their respective GitHub repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on CRAN."

For example, compiled files (think about .com, .exe, .o, .so, etc), archives (e.g.¬†.zip, .tar, .rar), logs (.log) and files generated in runtime (.temp) do not have to be tracked by Git. The same holds for hidden system files (e.g.¬†.DS_Store or Thumbs.db). Adding such filetypes to a file named .gitignore and placing that file in the root of your repository will take care of focusing Git‚Äôs energy on useful files only. For common .gitignore examples, see this repository. There are many examples inside, such as this .gitignore example for R"

In other words, if we would like to undo a commit, we can always go back to the previous HEAD stage ‚Äì&gt; the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the commit. Likewise, if we would like to undo a hard reset, we can also go back to the previous HEAD stage ‚Äì&gt; the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the reset.\nTo undo it all, we can use the indicator that is referenced by the reflog:\n\n% git reset --hard HEAD@{1}\nHEAD is now at 9e6c38c add two text files\n\nUsing reflog and HEAD is in this case more flexible than using log and the SHA-1 hash. reflog yields the log of all changes in the pointer HEAD, while log only gives you the history of the logged commits. Once a commit is undone, it is gone from the log. Moreover, using reflog and HEAD allows you to go back into the future, like in the above example.\nNOTE: Do not wait too long to undo your resets. After a few days/weeks garbage collection may kick in and Git will eventually see old commit as unreferenced. This makes them irretrievable"
