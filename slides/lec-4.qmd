## Today

- Reproducibility
- Research compendiums

![](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducibility.jpg)

## Why bother?

<!-- ***Research results are replicable if there is sufficient information available for independent researchers to make the same findings using the same procedures.  -->
<!-- [(Gary King, 1995)](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/replication.pdf)*** -->

We would like our results to be as fully reproducible as possible:

A. **Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science**

  - It is the standard by which to judge scientific claims
  - It helps the cumulative growth of knowledge - no duplication of effort

B. **Reproducibility may greatly benefit you**

  - You'll develop better work habits
  - Better teamwork - especially with new team members
  - Changing or amending your work is much easier
  - Higher research impact - more likely to be picked up and cited

# Reproducibility

## Crisis?

## Definition

![](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducible-matrix.jpg)

"A result is reproducible when the *same* analysis steps performed on the *same* dataset consistently produces the *same* answer".^[[The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions)]


## True or false?

<center>

In computational sciences - such as ours - 

simply having the data and code means that 

the results are not only replicable, 

but fully reproducible. 

</center>

## Reproducibility of `R` scripts

Reproducible research is not the norm: "74% of `R` files failed to complete without error" ([Trisovic, Lau, Pasquier, et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01143-6)) 

<!-- 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020 -->

<!-- ## Randomness{.build}  -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE} -->
<!-- set.seed(1)  -->
<!-- rnorm(3)  -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE} -->
<!-- rnorm(3)  -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE} -->
<!-- set.seed(1) -->
<!-- rnorm(6) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- seed setting to make sure you're not seed-dependent, e.g. morris simulation which was not replicable, but it was reproducible -->


<!-- ## We can reproduce individual samples -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 50, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 50, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## We can reproduce a chain of samples -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 5, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 7, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 5, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- sample(1:18, size = 7, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## The random seed  -->

<!-- The random seed is a number used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator -->

<!-- <!-- If replication is needed, pseudorandom number generators must be used --> -->

<!-- - Pseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers -->
<!-- - The properties of generated number sequences approximates the properties of random number sequences -->
<!-- - Pseudo-random number generators are not truly random, because the process is determined by an initial value. -->
<!-- - The initial value (the seed) itself does not need to be random. -->
<!-- - The resulting process is random because the seed value is not used to generate randomness -->
<!-- - It merely forms the starting point of the algorithm for which the results are random. -->


<!-- ## Why fix the random seed -->

<!-- If we fix the random seed we can exactly reproduce the random process -->

<!-- - But beware: the process depends on the seed -->
<!-- - The results obtained could theoretically be extremely rare and would not have occurred with every other potential seed -->
<!-- - Run another seed before publishing your results -->

<!-- If you don't set the seed yourself, it is done for you -->

<!-- - When an `R` instance is started, there is initially no seed. In that case, `R` will create one from the current time and process ID. -->
<!-- - Hence, different sessions will give different results when random numbers are involved. -->
<!-- - When you store a workspace and reopen it, you will continue from the seed specified within the workspace. -->


<!-- If the method has not changed: the results of the process will be identical when using the same seed. -->
<!-- - Replications allows for verification -->

<!-- </center> -->

<!-- ## Random processes -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- <img src="fig/random_process.pdf" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 80%> -->
<!-- </center> -->

<!-- ## `RStudio` projects -->

<!-- - Every project has its own history -->
<!-- - Every research project has its own project -->
<!-- - Every project can have its own folder, which also serves as a research archive -->
<!-- - Every project can have its own version control system -->
<!-- - RStudio projects can relate to Git (or other online) repositories -->

## Definition

- "A research compendium is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including 
  - data, 
  - code, 
  - texts
  - ...
- The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward"[^1]
- "The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection"[^2]

## In practice

![](https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/styles/image_1600x300/public/RDM%20internetbanner.jpg)
Research Data Management Support workshop: 

[**Writing Reproducible Manuscripts in R and Python**](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html)

## Steps

- Think about a good folder structure 
  - Split up 'read-only', 'human-generated', and 'project-generated' files
- Create folder structure (main directory and sub directories)
  - Add a landing page in the form of a README document
  - Make the compendium executable (to automatically generate the results; optional)
  - Make the compendium into a git repository (optional)
- Add all files needed for reproducing the results of the project
  - Avoid 'hard coded' parameters or human intervention in the execution
- Make the compendium as clean and easy to use as possible
  - Include a citation file and a LICENSE file with info on how it can be used
- Publish your compendium
  - E.g. on Zenodo (optional, more on this in the last course week)

## Checklist

- Completeness: The research compendium contains all of the objects needed to reproduce a predefined outcome.
- Organization: It is easy to understand and keep track of the various objects in the research compendium and their relationship over time.
- Economy: Fewer extraneous objects in the compendium mean fewer things that can break and require less maintenance over time.
- Transparency: The research compendium provides full disclosure of the research process that produced the scientific claim.
- Documentation: Information describing compendium objects is provided in enough detail to enable independent understanding and use of the compendium.

## Checklist

- Access: It is clear who can use what, how, and under what conditions, with open access preferred.
- Provenance: The origin of the components of the research compendium and how each has changed over time is evident.
- Metadata: Information about the research compendium and its components is embedded in a standardized, machine-readable code.
- Automation: As much as possible, the computational workflow is script- or workflow-based so that the workflow can be re-executed using minimal actions.
- Review: A series of managed activities needed to ensure continued access to and functionality of the research compendium and its components for as long as necessary.
