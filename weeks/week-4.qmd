# Introduction 

Dear all, 

This week, it's all coming together: you will apply your newly acquired markup language skills and build a reproducible research archive from scratch. We will assume that, by now, you're familiar with Git and GitHub. If that's not the case, please refer to last weeks' course materials.

All the best, 

Gerko and Hanne

# Preparation

## Read [Boulesteix, Groenwold, Abrahamowicz, et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039921) 

Most of the paper may be skimmed through, but make sure to closely read the penultimate section named "An example of a statistical simulation". This will be this week's case study.

The interested reader may also consider reading the original [Morris, White, & Crowther (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8086) paper, that Boulesteix et al. (2020) is based on, since the target audience of 'Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods' overlaps significantly with graduate students in statistics.

<!-- ## Browse the `Quarto` website -->
<!-- The people at `Posit` have designed [this awesome companion website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) that details pretty much everything `Quarto`. Have a look around and remember this source when you're in need of some additional functionality. Much of what you can do with `Quarto` is detailed here.  -->

# Exercise 1

Follow this tutorial to create a research compendium: https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html 

The contents of the compendium will consist of the simulation study performed by Boulesteix et al. (2020), see the next excercise for more information.
<!-- Bring this presentation to the next class -->

---

# Exercise 2

Substitute the contents of the empty research compendium you've just created by improving the supplement from Boulesteix et al. (2020).

Create a reproducible document that describes the simulation study and presents results.

<!-- The document should include the following statistics: -->

<!--  - absolute bias -->
<!--  - standard error -->
<!--  - lower bound of the 95% confidence interval -->
<!--  - upper bound of the 95% confidence interval -->

Submit the research compendium to this year's GitHub repo.
