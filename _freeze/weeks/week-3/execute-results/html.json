We discussed the flow of development with `Git` in class. You can find my (Gerko) 3-slide presentation exercise from week 2 [here](../slides/lec-3.qmd)\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Introduction\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"65%\"}\nDear all,\n\nAs a statistician / data scientist / developer you'll need to master many skills. Some of these skills are made simple with tools. This week we'll bite the bullet by learning about two massively important tools for your toolset: **version controlling** and *simulation*.\n\nTo document our activity and our changes in detail, we'll use [`Git`](https://git-scm.com). You can view `Git` as the ability to go back in time. Back to the very beginning of your project. A bonus: `Git` integrates nicely with `RStudio`. In this series of exercises we will learn\n\n1.  How to integrate `Git` within our projects.\n2.  How to publish our projects as `GitHub` repositories\n3.  How to go about development with `Git` and `GitHub`\n4.  How to solve scenarios where `Git` hits the fan.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile we'll also Monte Carlo simulate one of the most important concepts in statistics:\n\n4.  Confidence Validity\n\nUse the appropriate channels to ask questions and hand-in your work.\n\nAll the best,\n\nGerko and Hanne\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/forfun.png){width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Preparation\n\nRead [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) by [Jennifer Bryan](https://jennybryan.org) and watch the following clip where Linus Torvalds explains that he merely created `Git` to manage his [*other project*](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)\n\n<center>\n\n::: {style=\"max-width:480px\"}\n::: {style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"}\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Supplementary material\n\n-   [Git](https://git-scm.com) The following links are very useful:\n\n-   An [old video walkthrough](Archive/2019/Wk5/Solution%20Ex6.mp4) about `Git` and `Rstudio`\n\n-   [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary) for all terminology\n\n-   [become a `Git` Guru](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)\n\n-   [this online `Git` book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource\n\n-   [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `Git` and `R`.\n\nIn previous years, we also discussed Monte Carlo simulation in detail in class. If you want to learn more about this, then study [this old markup languages course page](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/#week-1).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Exercise 1: `Git` and GitHub\n\n## `Git`\n\n`Git` is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. `Git` is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project's changes.\n\nYou can see `Git` as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct `Git` to log any changes that have been made, `Git` adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas [`commits`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit). With every `commit` an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:\n\n-   the changes made\n-   who made the changes\n-   metadata\n-   a small piece of text that describe the changes made\n\nThe difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called [`diffs`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#diff).\n\nIf you'd like to know much more about `Git`, [this online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource. If you'd like to practice with the command line interface [use this webpage](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for a quick course. [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `Git` and `R`.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## `GitHub`\n\n`GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).\n\nYour public repositories can be viewed and [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone).\n\n`GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.\n\nFor now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits `GitHub` can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the `mice` package in `R` can be directly installed from the `mice` repository with the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(repo = \"stefvanbuuren/mice\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can see that this process requires package `devtools` that expands the `R` functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in `R` directly from their respective `GitHub` repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Installing `Git`\n\n### Installing on Mac\n\nI suggest you install `Git` by downloading and installing [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`.\n\nWhen installed, you can go to `GitHub Desktop > Install Command Line Tool`\n\nAfter a reboot, all should be set.\n\n### Installing on Windows\n\nDownload and install [`Git for Windows`](https://gitforwindows.org), Then download and install [`GitHub Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally, integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`.\n\nAfter a reboot, all should be set.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Command line interface vs. GUI\n\nUltimately, you'll want to learn how to use `Git` through the command line interface (CLI). It offers better and more comprehensive functionality. Again, [take this 15-minute course](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to get a gentle introduction. But do not be afraid that you miss out on the CLI if you don't study this link: In week 4 we'll explore in detail how to handle `Git` when things go haywire. You'll be a CLI-wizard by then.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## .gitignore\n\nGitHub sees every file in your repository as one of the following three\n\n-   **tracked files** that have been (previously) staged and committed\n-   **untracked files** that have not been staged or committed\n-   **ignored files** that have been explicitly ignored\n\nIt may be wise to instruct `Git` to ignore changes in some files. For example, compiled files (think about `.com`, `.exe`, `.o`, `.so`, etc), archives (e.g. `.zip`, `.tar`, `.rar`), logs (`.log`) and files generated in runtime (`.temp`) do not have to be tracked by `Git`. The same holds for hidden system files (e.g. `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db`). Adding such filetypes to a file named `.gitignore` and placing that file in the root of your repository will take care of focusing `Git`'s energy on useful files only. For common `.gitignore` examples, see [this repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). There are many examples inside, such as [this `.gitignore` example for `R`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Linking `GitHub` and `RStudio`\n\nSecurely linking your local machine to the remote repository is vital when collaborating with other people. In short; you would not want a potential hacker to have contributor access to any of your projects. I have prepared [this walkthrough video](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Link%20Git%20and%20RStudio.mp4) that details the process of linking `GitHub` to your machine and `RStudio`. Below I explain the rationale of using both an SSH key and a personal access token.\n\nIf you still experience problems after following my walkthrough, check [this chapter](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)\n\nTo learn more about maintaining a package as `GitHub` repository within `RStudio`, have a look at [this guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## SSH keys\n\nWith an SSH key you can identify yourself to an online server (in this case the `GitHub` server) without having to log in every time. It is like your machine having access to an online server through a unique biometric security measure, but instead of biometric data a bits-and-bytes hash code is communicated every time. You can use an SSH key to link `RStudio` to your `GitHub` repository, but it is better to use a personal access token for this. See below.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Personal access tokens\n\nIf you use `GitHub`'s 2FA functionality - **you should!** - your username and password are not sufficient to `push` `commits` to `GitHub` through `RStudio`. To solve this follow these steps on [github.com](https://github.com) like I detail in [this walkthrough video](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Link%20Git%20and%20RStudio.mp4):\n\n1.  Log in to your account\n2.  Click on your profile photo (upper right corner) and select `Settings`\n3.  Go to `Developer settings`\n4.  Select `Personal access tokens` in the left sidebar. The classic token as it is now called is sufficient\n5.  Click `Generate new token`\n6.  Give the token a name\n7.  Select at least the `repo` scope; you'll need these permissions to access repositories. Also choose a relevant expiration: the longer the better, the shorter the safer. Remember that you can always generate a new token if you need to.\n8.  Click Generate token\n\nCopy the token. The token will not be displayed again, so copy-paste it directly where it is needed. Remember that you can always generate a new token if you need to.\n\nIn `RStudio`, paste the generated token in the password field when `RStudio` asks for your credentials. The token will now serve as the unique authenticated link instead of your password.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## `Git` exercise\n\n1.  Fork this year's course repository. See also [this walkthrough video](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Creating%20a%20branch.mp4) I've made for you that details the next couple of steps, but then on a previous Markup Languages iteration's repository (markup2020).\n2.  Clone the fork to your machine\n3.  Create a new branch\n4.  Add your output for the exercises from previous weeks to a folder with your name to the repository. \n5.  Commit the changes\n6.  Push to your `GitHub` fork\n7.  Send a pull request to incorporate your changes into the `upstream/master` branch (i.e. `gerkovink/markup2023`). I have made [another walkthrough video](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Create%20PR.mp4) for you that details this step - but then on the markup2020 repository.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Monte Carlo simulation exercise (no need to hand in)\n\n1.  Perform a small simulation that does the following:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\na.  Sample 100 samples from a standard normal distribution.\nb.  For each of these samples, calculate the following statistics for the mean:\n\n-   absolute bias\n-   standard error\n-   lower bound of the 95% confidence interval\n-   upper bound of the 95% confidence interval\n\nc.  Create a plot that demonstrates the following:\n\n***\"A replication of the procedure that generates a 95% confidence interval that is centered around the sample mean would cover the population value at least 95 out of 100 times\"*** [(Neyman, 1934)](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjk4LaD6LrXAhUGC8AKHdATBhMQFggoMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.cmu.edu%2F~brian%2F905-2008%2Fpapers%2Fneyman-1934-jrss.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3KRw9DSklPihrYIM0_zRrC)\n\nd.  Present a table containing all simulated samples for which the resulting confidence interval does not contain the population value.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## My solutions to the exercises\n\n-   [My old solution to the MC exercise](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Solution_to_Ex1.html)\n-   [My solution to the MC exercise as I would do it now](https://www.gerkovink.com/oldmarkup/Wk1/Solution_to_Ex1_future.html)\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Exercise 2: `Git` it done\n\nThis week we will also learn how to use $git$ properly when we mess up. But let's not learn that on this year's repo ;-). Fork the an old course repository [here](https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020), deselect! `Copy the master branch only` in order to copy all branches and checkout the `Exercise_wk4` branch.\n\nLet's continue this week with this second exercise.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI'll take you by the hand through the exercise. So if you follow this manual step by step, you'll be done at the end and you will have a good notion of troubleshooting with `Git` \\[or a reference thereof\\].\n\nThis exercise is a summary of important commands. A full and comprehensive overview can be found in [the `pro Git` book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n\nO, and we forgot to tell you: you'll need the terminal for this exercise. You may use the one in `RStudio`, or the dedicated terminal on UNIX systems or the command prompt or [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) on Windows.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Prepare\n\nBefore we continue it is good to all start from the point of departure.\n\n1.  Use the terminal to navigate to the `Git` repository (the location of the git repo on your HDD)\n2.  Type `git pull` to make sure that you obtain the latest state from the remote on `GitHub`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git pull\nAlready up to date.\n```\n:::\n\n\nDon't type the `%`; that is just the command prompt indicator on my machine. Yours may be different, such as `>` or `$`. We see that `Git` reminds me that I already have the latest state. I am up to date.\n\n3.  Change the branch to the `Exercise_wk4` branch.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git checkout Exercise_wk4\nSwitched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.\n```\n:::\n\n\nI've now been switched to the `Exercise_wk4` branch. It is up to date with `origin/Exercise_wk4`, meaning that GitHub and my local copy are in sync. `origin` is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. It is useful that `origin` is referenced instead of the original repo's URL --\\> This makes referencing much more convenient.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Inspect the current state\n\nMake sure you are in the `Exercise_wk4` branch. Then Use `git log --graph` to inspect the current Git branch and its commits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git log --graph          \n*   commit 176137b1667cc6903f7a9eead5723892ef1a77a7 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\n|\\  Merge: 0e67723 c902093\n| | Author: Gerko Vink <g.vink@uu.nl>\n| | Date:   Thu Oct 29 12:44:01 2020 +0100\n| | \n| |     Merge pull request #38 from thomasjwise/wisedev\n| |     \n| |     Assignment 3 - Beamer PDF\n| |     \n| |     Well done ✅\n| | \n| * commit c9020931678d90d91cfe21778e6ce5b4943e46cb\n| | Author: Thomas Wise <48682160+thomasjwise@users.noreply.github.com>\n| | Date:   Wed Oct 28 13:59:23 2020 +0100\n| | \n| |     Assignment 3 - Beamer PDF\n| |   \n* |   commit 0e67723572744b769389f5b8883c9f1aa6a3b7dd\n|\\ \\  Merge: 4134b75 1f488c6\n| | | Author: Gerko Vink <g.vink@uu.nl>\n| | | Date:   Thu Oct 29 11:27:16 2020 +0100\n| | | \n```\n:::\n\n\nWe see information about the history that brought us to this point in time. We see commit messages, the author, the dates, the SHA-1 hash and the graph tree. We asked for the graph tree with `--graph`.\n\nYou can scroll up and down the graph. To exit the graph window, type `q`. For help, type `h`. To obtain a more condensed graph, use\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git log --oneline --graph\n*   176137b (HEAD -> Exercise_wk4, origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/Exercise_wk4, master) Merge pull request #38 from thomasjwise/wisedev\n|\\  \n| * c902093 Assignment 3 - Beamer PDF\n* |   0e67723 Merge pull request #39 from gerkovink/SofieIssue\n|\\ \\  \n| * | 1f488c6 (SofieIssue) remove pipe operator\n| * | 4ead406 update readme.md\n|/ /  \n* |   4134b75 Merge pull request #37 from pietjonker/piet\n|\\ \\  \n| * | f50014b commit assignment 2\n| * | 5ae2b9b Assignment 1 and 2\n* | |   f277a35 Merge pull request #35 from zoedunias/zoedev\n|\\ \\ \\  \n| * | | 1c9aad6 Added Exercise 2\n* | | |   43fb1ed Merge pull request #34 from RianneKraakman/riannedev\n|\\ \\ \\ \\  \n| * | | | 75d9293 Add assignment 2\n* | | | |   d3df110 Merge pull request #33 from gerkovink/gerkodev\n|\\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \n| * \\ \\ \\ \\   34954f8 (origin/gerkodev, gerkodev) Merge pull request #22 from Goorbergh/ruben_assignment_1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis graph view is much more condensed. The nice thing about this view is the direct depiction of each action's abbreviated SHA-1 key.\n\nWe can use the SHA-1 keys to instruct `Git`. For example, to obtain the history on commit `c902093`, we only need to refer the SHA-1 hash.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git log c902093          \ncommit c9020931678d90d91cfe21778e6ce5b4943e46cb\nAuthor: Thomas Wise <48682160+thomasjwise@users.noreply.github.com>\nDate:   Wed Oct 28 13:59:23 2020 +0100\n\n    Assignment 3 - Beamer PDF\n\ncommit db649539738bb30b63d93053b67891ef6c55037e\nAuthor: Thomas Wise <48682160+thomasjwise@users.noreply.github.com>\nDate:   Wed Sep 16 14:04:21 2020 +0200\n\n    Assignment 1\n\ncommit 21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3\nMerge: 7f0806b f4a11cb\nAuthor: Gerko Vink <g.vink@uu.nl>\nDate:   Tue Sep 15 20:15:25 2020 +0200\n\n    Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\n    \n    This image is too large\n\ncommit f4a11cbed729bc8454c01866aab4291b3b580d6f\nAuthor: Gerko Vink <g.vink@uu.nl>\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr, a more condensed version of the same\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git log c902093 --pretty=oneline\nc9020931678d90d91cfe21778e6ce5b4943e46cb Assignment 3 - Beamer PDF\ndb649539738bb30b63d93053b67891ef6c55037e Assignment 1\n21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\nf4a11cbed729bc8454c01866aab4291b3b580d6f resize image\n7f0806b68387d4f3c8af5c1f27d94b69e90a2d13 Merge pull request #1 from gerkovink/gerkodev\na36ed81b3831e6084c2adf661dc4cfb32c4cb5f7 add childhood memory\n9ba9c43437a7f00f5095df55db0c07d7233ad152 Add CV\n9bf1c32ea55b60bce613d65765c18deb522772ff Update .gitignore\n18761716665262f19296fb5d8e7c1720c8cea58a Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2020\n1ee60aa26142b5f175928d409614b8de84c1ef79 Update .gitignore\n7c3d816264b5629e7bfe112954178648d94a37b4 Delete markup_sticker_SMALL.psd\n37c356ca51b4ed03e96570934f28caf5fcfd75d8 Delete .DS_Store\nd56dd90172d1106117d53102e5053165bc182020 Update .gitignore\ne7b78b592a8000d3a647de3a265c69496adebfe5 Update .gitignore\nfdd923ad2b522d6e4357229ea801d23ec5b16717 update readme\n7e14559d7f7e8676d557c9b73fc43fb3a66a0c3c added sticker\n493609efa7ce659ebebf5a0d0300f23788397e68 Initial commit\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease note that we only reference the short hash.

You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c <new-branch-name>\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are now at the old state. So we went back in time. The current state where we are is independent from all later commits, but is built exactly on all preceding commits as per the tree.\n\nThere are a couple of terms that are *new*:\n\n-   HEAD: *The HEAD in `Git` is the pointer to the current branch reference. It is the last commit you have made or checked out \\[in our case\\].* **REMEMBER that the head will always serve as the parent to the next commit**\n-   detached HEAD: *The same as the head, but now the pointer references a specific commit and not a branch.*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The problem with a detached HEAD\n\n[This webpage](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/detached-head-when-checkout-commit/) illustrates the dangers of committing changes under a detached head quite nicely:\n\n> The HEAD pointer in `Git` determines your current working revision (and thereby the files that are placed in your project's working directory). Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. You are automatically on the newest commit of the chosen branch. <br><br> When you instead choose to check out a commit hash, `Git` won't do this for you. The consequence is that when you make changes and commit them, these changes do NOT belong to any branch. This means they can easily get lost once you check out a different revision or branch: not being recorded in the context of a branch, you lack the possibility to access that state easily (unless you have a brilliant memory and can remember the commit hash of that new commit...).\n\nThe useful thing about going to an old commit is that you can take this state as a point of departure. Just beware of the pitfalls of working under a detached HEAD.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### leave the detached HEAD\n\nGo back to the branch HEAD\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git switch -                    \nPrevious HEAD position was 21a3b5a Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev\nSwitched to branch 'Exercise_wk4'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/Exercise_wk4'.\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Make a new branch of the old state\n\nLet's take that old state and make it into a proper point of departure for new things. Again, reference `21a3b5ac1535703f4ce0d6feb2ccf3703f95eee3 Merge pull request #2 from gerkovink/gerkodev`, but now we make the state of `21a3b5a` into a new branch. We call that branch `Wk4_markup`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git checkout -b Wk4_markup 21a3b5a \nSwitched to a new branch 'Wk4_markup'\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now have checked out an old state and made it into a new branch. The cool thing is that we can now commit all we want and everything will be properly logged. Just remember that if you'd like to go back in time and play around with an old state of your project --\\> **Merge the old state into a new branch** like I demonstrated above.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Add a new commit\n\nWe start by creating an empty text file\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% touch add_text_file.txt\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf the `touch` command does not work on your machine, you may also create this file by hand.\n\nNow, if we would like to commit the addition of this file to our repo, we get the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git commit -a -m 'add text file'\nOn branch Wk4_markup\nUntracked files:\n\tadd_text_file.txt\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe commit was not succesfull, because the file `add_text_file.txt` is not yet tracked. Note that I use `-a` to specify to commit **all** changed files and folders that are tracked. I use `-m` to indicate that I would like to add the message `add text file`.\n\nYou see that using a GUI to `Git` like GitHub desktop or RStudio is quite convenient if you would not like to indicate which files to track.

Likewise, if we would like to undo a hard reset, we can also go back to the previous HEAD stage --\\> the HEAD has been moved one step forward by the reset.\n\nTo undo it all, we can use the indicator that is referenced by the `reflog`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n% git reset --hard HEAD@{1}\nHEAD is now at 9e6c38c add two text files\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing `reflog` and HEAD is in this case more flexible than using `log` and the SHA-1 hash. `reflog` yields the log of all changes in the pointer HEAD, while `log` only gives you the history of the logged commits. Once a commit is undone, it is gone from the `log`. Moreover, using `reflog` and HEAD allows you to go back into the future, like in the above example.\n\n**NOTE: Do not wait too long to undo your resets. After a few days/weeks garbage collection may kick in and `Git` will eventually see old commit as unreferenced. This makes them irretrievable**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Redo a commit\n\nA hard reset brings you back to a previous state.
