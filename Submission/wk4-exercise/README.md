The goal of my-reproducible-manuscript is to provide other contributors with access to the research I conducted and be able to reproduce it. In this specific case, we created a function to perform additions.

The project was conducted by Adam Maghout (Utrecht University, the Netherlands). The current repository was put together on the 6th of November.
