This repository contains the completed exercise 4 for the course in Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming in Statistics by Utrecht University. The documents in it are as follows:

- The docs folder contains the code to perform the analysis, as well as an explanation of the variables. 'My reproducible document week 4 exercise.pdf' is the knitted version of the document.
- The data folder contains the six datasets necessary to perform the analysis. These are labelled according to the [NHANES website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).
- The renv folder contains the packages that are necessary to conduct the analysis, working at the time this was put together in R 4.4.2.
- The other folders are unnecessary and only included as they were part of another exercise prior to this one.
